Product containing fractions were evaporated to dryness to afford 4-bromo-3-fluoro-1H-indazole (4.20 g, 15%) as <e1> a pale yellow solid </e1> Product containing fractions were evaporated to dryness to afford <e2> 4-bromo-3-fluoro-1H-indazole (4.20 g, 15%) </e2> as a pale yellow solid.
<e1> The combined organic extracts </e1> were dried over sodium sulfate, filtered and concentrated. <e2> The phases </e2> were separated, and the aqueous phase was adjusted to pH 1-2 with 1 M hydrochloric acid and extracted three times with ethyl acetate.
An organic layer was obtained by performing an extraction process on <e1> the reaction mixture </e1> three times by using ethyl acetate and water. Synthesis of Intermediate Compound (ii) <e2> The Intermediate Compound (i) </e2> was dissolved in tetrahydrofuran (0.05 M, solvent), cooled to a temperature of 0째 C., and then stirred for 0.5 hours.
<e2> The mixture </e2> is stirred for 10 min after the addition is complete and cooled to 5째 C. <e1> The crystals </e1> are removed by filtration, washed copiously with acetone, and dried to give 408 g of the title compound mp 142-145째 C. A second crop (30 g, mp 142-145째 C.) is obtained by decolorizing and concentrating the acetone washes.
Intermediate 25 6-(Chloroacetyl)-3,4-dihydroquinolin-2(1H)-one (0.300 g, 1.34 mmol) and <e2> urea (1.61 g, 26.82 mmol) </e2> dissolve in anhydrous acetonitrile (30 ml) in <e1> a flask </e1> under argon atmosphere.
